Idea
====
Easilydo is a smart virtual assistant, which discovers tasks and executes them - https://easilydo.com/ 

I applied this idea to Operations. For example, an anomaly would be "discovered" and a preset task would 
be executed. During the hackathon - we could BYO (Bring your own) discovery and execution. In my case, 
I discover flapping and I execute a task to remove the flapping server from the Load Balancer. 
In the demo, the app asks for permission to "DO IT". In a more polished setup, if the confidence level of 
discovery is high, it can simply execute it without bothering anyone.

Thank you AWS for the awesome APIs :)
